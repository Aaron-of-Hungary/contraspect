$ rosrun contraspect Dn_node X Y Z DEMO_OPTIONAL

Simulation node of the Drone (Dn)
Initialize BEFORE Beacons (Bcns)

INTERNAL VARS
double** map:		Map containing position coords of Dn and Bcns
double* status:		Current direction and magnitude of Dn movement
double clk:		Internal clock
double* beacons_delay:	Delay in s of triang signal to arrive from Bcns
double* beacons_dist:	Distance in m of Bcns from Dn. Calc from delay
bool* triang_recvd:	Received triang msg from Bcns
bool* triang_irreg:	Recvd triang msg irregular compared to previous
bool* init_pos_irreg:   Recvd bcn_init_pos msg irregular
bool demo:		Dn_node is running in demo mode

SUBSCRIBE TO
Triang:		Receives message from Bcns to calculate own position
Triang_demo:	Used instead of Triang topic in demo mode
Bcn_init_pos:	Receives pos coords from Bcn at init to store in map
Dn_ctrl:	Receives mvmt instructions from Dcs_node
Clk_sync:	Receives command to reset internal clock from DCS_node

PUBLISH TO
Dn_status_map:	Publishes Dn and Bcns coordinates to DCS
CLK:		Publishes internal clock
Dn_calc:	Publishes position from triang msgs calculation method

INIT VARS
X    		X init coord		format: 1.0
Y Z 		Like X
DEMO_OPTIONAL	Run in demo mode	format: demo

DEMO MODE
Instead of going directly to Dn_node from Beacon_node,
TRIANG msg sent via Loc_sim with added delay.
This simulates sound travel duration through space.
