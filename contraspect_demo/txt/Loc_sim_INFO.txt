$ rosrun contraspect_demo Loc_sim

Demo mode simulator of sound travel duration through space
Initialize BEFORE Bcn_node and with Dn_node in DEMO mode

INTERNAL VARS
double** map:		Map containing position coords of Dn and Bcns
double* status:		Current direction and magnitude of Dn movement
double* beacons_dist:	Distance in m of Bcns from Dn. Use to calc delay
double* beacons_delay:	Delay in s of triang signal to send to Dn
double* recvd_timestamp:Timestamp to calc delay of triang send from Bcn
double* delay_counter:	Delay timer to forward triang msg to Dn from Bcn
bool* triang_recvd:	Received and saved triang msg from Bcns
bool* triang_sent:	Forwarded triang msg to Dn
bool* init_pos_irreg:   Recvd bcn_init_pos msg irregular
bool dn_pos_recvd:	Recvd and saved Dn_pos via Dn_status_map topic

SUBSCRIBE TO
Triang:		Receives triang msgs from Bcns before forwarding
Bcn_init_pos: 	Receives Bcn pos coords at init to save in map
Dn_ctrl:	Receives Movement instr from DCS and moves Dn
Dn_status_map:	Receives Dn pos coords to save in map

PUBLISH TO
Triang_demo:	Publishes triang msgs with delay for Dn to calc pos
Loc_sim_calc:	Publishes triang msgs delay from map calculation method

INIT VARS
n/a

DEMO MODE
Instead of going directly to Dn_node from Beacon_node,
TRIANG msg sent via Loc_sim with added delay.
This simulates sound travel duration through space.
Loc_sim calcs Beacon delays, adds delay to triang msgs.
